The chip is in the center. </p>
1. **QFN PACAKGE** </p>
- QFN is a no lead package.Like any other IC package , the function of QFN package is to connect silicon die of the IC to the circuit board. </p>
2. **PAD** </p>
- Pad is used to send signal from inside to outside and vice versa . </p>
3. **DIE** </p>
-  die, in the context of integrated circuits, is a small block of semiconducting material on which a given functional circuit is fabricated. </p>
4. **CORE** </p>
-  Processor cores can be a microcontroller, microprocessor (Î¼P),digital signal processor (DSP) or application-specific instruction set processor (ASIP) core </p>
5. **Foundary IPs** </p>
- IPs are designed and are essential to design PLL , ADC and SRAM . </p>
6. **Macros** </p>
- Macros are designs that are frequently used in circuit design. </p>
7. **IO Pads** </p>
- IO pads are a way of communication between the core and the outside world. </p>
D1_SKY_L2 -- Introduction to RISC -V </p>
ISA - Instruction Set Architecture . As we know computers only understand binary numbers. But we as humans are aware of writing high level programming languages such as C , C++,Python ,etc. In this process, RISC -V Implementation is done and then transfered to machine level. Bits get executed to layout . HDL is way to interact with RISC-V and layout design. </p>
