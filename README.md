2. **PAD** </p>
- Pad is used to send signal from inside to outside and vice versa . </p>
3. **DIE** </p>
-  die, in the context of integrated circuits, is a small block of semiconducting material on which a given functional circuit is fabricated. </p>
4. **CORE** </p>
-  Processor cores can be a microcontroller, microprocessor (Î¼P),digital signal processor (DSP) or application-specific instruction set processor (ASIP) core </p>

7. **IO Pads** </p>
- IO pads are a way of communication between the core and the outside world. </p>
##### D1_SKY_L2 **-- Introduction to RISC -V** </p>
ISA - Instruction Set Architecture . As we know computers only understand binary numbers. But we as humans are aware of writing high level programming languages such as C , C++,Python ,etc. In this process, RISC -V Implementation is done and then transfered to machine level. Bits get executed to layout . HDL is way to interact with RISC-V and layout design. </p>

##### D1_SKY_L3 **From Software Applications to Hardware** </p>
When a use any application , there are many functions and features that we encounter. There is not a direct path between the software and the hardware , it goes through various stages before interacting with the hardware. </p>

- Operating System OS : The task of OS is to convert the general tasks and various I/O operations into high level language like C,C++ </p>
- Compiler - Compiler converts the C/C++ code into instructions in the form of *.exe file </p>
- Assembler - The job of assembler is to covert instructions tinto binary which is then fed to hardware and it generates the output. </p>
#### D1_SK2 SOC Design and Openlane </p>
##### D1_SKY_L1 **Introduction to all components of an open-source digital ASIC designV** </p>
1. **RTL Design** </p>
RTL design is a crucial step in the VLSI design flow, which involves the creation of electronic circuits using integrated circuits (ICs). It involves the specification of a digital circuit in terms of the flow of digital signals between hardware registers, and the logical operations performed on those signals. </p>
2. **EDA Tools** </p>
Electronic design automation (EDA), also referred to as electronic computer-aided design (ECAD), is a category of software tools for designing electronic systems such as integrated circuits and printed circuit boards. </p>
3. **PDKs** </p>
Process Design Kits are the interface between the Fabrication companies and the designers. They seperate the design from the technology. </p>
4. **Google Skywater 130nm PDK** </p>
The Google SkyWater 130nm PDK is an open-source Process Design Kit (PDK) provided by SkyWater Technology Foundry in collaboration with Google. </p>

1. RTL - RTL is an implementation of digital circuits using Verilog </p>
2. Synthesis - It is used to convert RTL implementation into gate level netlistwith the help of a standard cell lobrary. </p>
3. Floor/Power Planning - It is the arrangement of different blocks and elements for minimizing the area for the peripherals and the IO pads.Power planning is used for the efficient power distribution throughtout the chip. </p>
4. Place - It is performed in two stages a) Global Placement - where optimal position is done and b) Detailed Placement - SC are minimally altered . </p>
5. Clock Tree Synthesis - It verifies the clock signal has the connection made across the whole chip. It is used to minimize clock skew, latency. </p>
6. Routing - Connects the placed standard cells with metal wires, creating the final layout. </p>
7. Sign-off - Once routing is done , the chip undergoes verification steps like Timing Verifications (DRC and LVS) and STA for timing verifications. </p>

- OpenLane is an automated RTL to GDSII flow based on several components including OpenROAD, Yosys, Magic, Netgen, CVC, SPEF-Extractor, KLayout and a number of custom scripts for design exploration and optimization. The flow performs all ASIC implementation steps from RTL all the way down to GDSII. </p>
- In efabless , the company has a SoC called Strive.They have various versions and contains several features. </p>
